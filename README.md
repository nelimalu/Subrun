# Subrun
## Description
Subrun is our **ICS4U0** ISP submission. This is an educative video game for ages 10-15 with the goal of spreading awareness of the difficulties of living in a suburb in an entertaining manner.
## Controls
**L. Click** to move through text boxes<br>
**W / A / S / D** or **↑ / ↓ / → / ←** keys for movement

## Focus
Subrun tackles the issue of **urban sprawl** in suburban neighborhoods. The way such neighborhoods, like Vaughan and Davisville are constructed makes it so that everything is built kilometers apart, making it hard to get to where you need to get to without a car. This ends up contributing to the overall **traffic congestion** in these areas, while also making travel difficult for youth who can't get a driver's license or low-income households that can't afford a car.
## Progression
Subrun has 3 stages: **a learning level, a maze level, and an escape room level**. All levels can be replayed, however the next level can only be played of the previous level is completed (eg. Learning level would have to be completed before the user can access the Maze level.)
### Learning Level
The player is put through 11 frames of informative content with focus on the problems of urban sprawl while introducing game ideas revolving around transportation that the player will later be quizzed on in the maze level. Upon completion, the maze level will unlock itself.
### Maze Level
The player is put on a basic map with 3 simplified versions of the games the user will encounter in the escape room level. At each minigame, the user will first have to speak to the NPC at the game, go through dialogue, and answer a question before being able to play. After completing each minigame, the user will gain a star, trackable at the top left corner. Upon reaching 3 stars, the escape room level will be unlocked.
### Escape Room Level
The player is put into a final map with the 3 games to play. The player can talk to the NPCs on the map to enter a game. Each game has a minimum threshold requirement that must be met, whether it be score or completion. All 3 thresholds must be reached to complete the escape room, upon which the user will be met with a Congratulations! screen, with options to exit or return to the main menu. The thresholds for the 3 games are:
- Walking game: **5000 score**
- Biking game: **1200 score**
- Bus game: **completion**

## Possible Improvements

The core mechanics of the game are complete, but the player experience could be improved through some quality of life changes, which include:
- A flashing message that indicates once you've reached your required score on the walking and biking games in the escape room level
- Screens before entering the maze and escape room levels, explaining briefly what's required in each
- Making the locked level interface feel more accessible by showing what needs to be done to unlock each level
- Making it more clear where to find the bus game in the maze level
- Prompting the user to exit directly to the main screen rather than manually after completing all 3 stars in the maze level
